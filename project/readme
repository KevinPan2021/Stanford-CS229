Getting the image data:
	The data is pulled from aws server, "aws s3 cp --recursive s3://impact-datashare/transverse_bands  . --no-sign-request"

System requirement:
	Python 3.8 (or above)
	Tensorflow 2.4
	Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU - cuda 11.0 - cudnn 11.0  (or equivalent)
	RAM 16 GB (or more)

How to run the programs:
	1) Create a directory 
	2) Pull cloudstreet dataset from NASA AWS server, "aws s3 cp --recursive s3://impact-datashare/transverse_bands . --no-sign-request". 
	   Place the dataset "yes", "no" into the directory
	2) Download and extract "data_process.py", "Model_Classical.py", and "Model_DL.py" and place them in the same directory.
	3) Run "data_process.py" to generate 4 .npy files
	4) Run "Model_Classical.py" and "Model_DL.py" to perform classification tasks.
